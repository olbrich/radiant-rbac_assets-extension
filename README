=rbac_assets


Created for Radiant 0.8.0 and higher RBAC_Assets is an extension that utilizes the extension RBAC_Base to allow only users in the "Assets" role to edit assets. If you do not have the rbac_base extension installed it will raise a RbacSnippetsExtension::MissingRequirement exception when activated.

Truly the credit for this extension goes to Jim Gay at "SaturnFlyer":http://www.saturnflyer.com 
The inspiration and code for this extension is based on his excellent "RBAC_snippets":http://ext.radiantcms.org/extensions/88-rbac-snippets

See "RbacBaseExtension":http://ext.radiantcms.org/extensions/87-rbac-base
